The project involves interfacing a DHT sensor with an Arduino to measure temperature and humidity. The readings will be displayed on an LCD screen or through the serial monitor. The simulation of this setup will be carried out using the Wokwi simulator, which provides a virtual environment for testing and validating the functionality of the project.

### Objective

- To measure temperature and humidity using a DHT sensor.
- To display the measured readings on an LCD screen or serial monitor.
- To simulate the setup using the Wokwi simulator for testing and validation.

### Key Insights

- **Sensor Interfacing**: Understanding the connection and communication between the DHT sensor and the Arduino.
- **Data Acquisition**: Learning how to read data from the DHT sensor and process it within the Arduino.
- **Display Mechanism**: Exploring methods to display data on an LCD screen or through the serial monitor.
- **Simulation**: Utilizing the Wokwi simulator to virtually prototype and test the circuit before physical implementation.

### Technology Used

- **Arduino**: A microcontroller board used for interfacing with sensors and other hardware components.
- **DHT Sensor**: A digital sensor used for measuring temperature and humidity. **DHT22**- More precise and capable sensor compared to DHT11.
- **LCD Screen**: A display module used to show the temperature and humidity readings. Typically, a 16x2 LCD screen is used.
- **Wokwi Simulator**: An online tool for simulating Arduino projects, allowing for virtual testing and debugging.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Virtual Interface Setup**:
   - Connect the DHT sensor to the Arduino (power, ground, and data pin).
   - Connect the LCD screen to the Arduino (power, ground, and communication pins).

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Write the Arduino code to read data from the DHT sensor.
   - Display the data on the LCD screen or serial monitor.
   - Use libraries like `DHT` for sensor data and `LiquidCrystal` for LCD control.

3. **Simulation**:
   - Create the circuit in the Wokwi simulator.
   - Upload and run the Arduino code in the simulator.
   - Verify the readings and functionality through the virtual setup.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of interfacing a DHT sensor with an Arduino to measure temperature and humidity, and display the readings on an LCD screen or serial monitor. Using the Wokwi simulator allows for effective testing and validation of the circuit and code before physical implementation.
